               When you design a page to be a specific width, you need to decide a couple of things. 
               First, you need to pick the width, usually based on common monitor resolutions. As of 
               this writing, most sites are designed to be 960 pixels wide or thereabouts to fit nicely 
               in the most common 1024 × 768 monitor resolution. Some designers keep their layouts narrower; 
               some venture even larger as monitor resolution increases. Either way, it is a design decision. 
               You also need to 
               decide where the fixed-width layout should be positioned in the browser window. By default, 
               it stays on the left edge of the browser, with the extra space to the right of it. You can also 
               center the page, splitting the extra space over left and right margins, which may make the page 
               look as though it better fills the browser window.

           <div id="main">
               <h3>Main column</h3>
     
               <p>
                   
                   You also need to decide where the fixed-width layout should be 
                   positioned in the browser window. By default, it stays on the 
                   left edge of the browser, with the extra space to the right of it.
                   You can also center the page, splitting 
                   the extra space over left and right margins, which may make the page 
                   look as though it better fills the browser window. 
                   Now that you understand the principles of moving elements around on 
                   the page using CSS floats and positioning, we can put these tools to 
                   use in some standard page layouts. This chapter looks at the various 
                   approaches to CSSdriven web design and provides some simple templates 
                   that will get you on your way to building basic two- and three-column web pages. 
                    One of the main concerns with using fixed layouts is that if the user’s browser window is not as wide 
                    as the page, the content on the right edge of the page will be hidden. Although it is possible to 
                    scroll horizontally, it may not always be clear that there is more content there in the first place.
                    In addition, although the structure of the page doesn’t change, if a user has text set to a very large size to make it easier to read, there may be very few words on a line and the layout may look awkward or break altogether. 750px 750px
